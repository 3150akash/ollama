//   There was once a boy named Brave Boy who lived with his family near a forest. Brave Boy loved to play in the woods nearby and was not afraid of climbing trees and big rocks and hills.  His father was a hunter who would hunt animals and bring back food for his wife and son. Brave Boy’s father used to carry a black rock with him while going to hunt. As long as he had the black rock, he would always find animals to hunt and bring back for food.


//   One day, the father lost his black rock and could not bring back food. Slowly, the family’s food reserves were getting low, and they were starting to starve. Brave Boy’s mother asked him to find his father a black rock. Brave Boy started by searching the house for the rock. But he could not find any. Next, he thought of paying his friend Running Stream a visit, since he knew that she collected rocks. Unfortunately, Running Stream had rocks of various colours but did not have a single black rock.
  
   
  
//   Running Stream mentioned that black rocks were very popular and that she would give all her collected black rocks to a grumpy old man living up the Black Cliff. The old man would give her animals in return for these black rocks as he was a collector himself. She also mentioned that the grumpy old man believed that black rocks gave out luck and that he wanted to be the luckiest in the forest.

  review: `
  So, they still had the 17 piece system on seasonal \
sale for around $49 in the month of November, about \
half off, but for some reason (call it price gouging) \
around the second week of December the prices all went \
up to about anywhere from between $70-$89 for the same \
system. And the 11 piece system went up around $10 or \
so in price also from the earlier sale price of $29. \
So it looks okay, but if you look at the base, the part \
where the blade locks into place doesn’t look as good \
as in previous editions from a few years ago, but I \
plan to be very gentle with it (example, I crush \
very hard items like beans, ice, rice, etc. in the \ 
blender first then pulverize them in the serving size \
I want in the blender then switch to the whipping \
blade for a finer flour, and use the cross cutting blade \
first when making smoothies, then use the flat blade \
if I need them finer/less pulpy). Special tip when making \
smoothies, finely cut and freeze the fruits and \
vegetables (if using spinach-lightly stew soften the \ 
spinach then freeze until ready for use-and if making \
sorbet, use a small to medium sized food processor) \ 
that you plan to use that way you can avoid adding so \
much ice if at all-when making your smoothie. \
After about a year, the motor was making a funny noise. \
I called customer service but the warranty expired \
already, so I had to buy another one. FYI: The overall \
quality has gone done in these types of products, so \
they are kind of counting on brand recognition and \
consumer loyalty to maintain sales. Got it in about \
two days.
